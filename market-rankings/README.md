# Market Rankings
This is the repository for Amberdata's Market Rankings blog post. The `notebooks` repository contains the full Jupyter notebook for the post, and `src` is an equivalent Python package.

## Usage
This package was written and tested in `Python 3.7.7`. Once you have installed the dependencies with:  
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```,  

you can easily edit the parameters in `src/config.py` or write your own query and run the main script with:
```python3 src/main.py```.  

Add your free API key when prompted, and enjoy!
